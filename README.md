## Why Commentary?

Stay in flow while reviewing your Markdown. Commentary brings **Google Docs-style commenting** to rendered previews in VS Code. Review documentation as readers will see it, annotate without editing source files, and send feedback directly to your AI agent.

**Perfect for:**
- 📖 Documentation writers reviewing drafts
- ✍️ Technical writers collecting feedback
- 👥 Content reviewers annotating without commits
- 🤖 AI-assisted workflows with Claude Code, Cursor Agent, Codex, or Gemini

## ✨ Features

### Non-Destructive Comments
- **Text selection** — Highlight any text to comment
- **Document-level** — Comment on entire files
- **Floating bubble UI** — Google Docs-style comment interface
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — `⌘Enter` / `Ctrl+Enter` to save, `Esc` to cancel
- **Visual highlights** — See exactly what's commented

### AI Agent Integration

**CLI Tools (Send) — Recommended**
- **Claude Code** — Terminal integration, stays open for continued interaction
- **Cursor Agent** — Terminal integration, stays open for continued interaction
- **Codex CLI** — Terminal integration with automation mode
- **Gemini CLI** — Terminal integration with Google's AI

**Manual (Copy)**
- **Claude IDE** — Clipboard copy, paste into Claude chat
- **Cursor IDE** — Clipboard copy, paste into Cursor chat
- **VS Code Chat** — Clipboard copy, paste into built-in chat

💡 **CLI methods** pipe comments to agentic tools that automatically apply edits and stay open for follow-up. **Manual methods** copy to clipboard for you to paste—useful when CLI isn't available.

### Mermaid Diagrams
Render diagrams directly in your Markdown preview:
- **Flowcharts** — Process flows and decision trees
- **Sequence diagrams** — API interactions and workflows
- **Class diagrams** — Architecture documentation
- **State diagrams** — State machines and transitions
- **Pie charts** — Data visualization
- **And more** — Entity relationships, Git graphs, timelines

Diagrams automatically adapt to your VS Code theme (light/dark).

### Beautiful Themes
Choose from **20 professional themes**:
- **Water.css** — Modern, clean (light/dark)
- **Sakura** — Elegant (5 variants)
- **Pico CSS** — Professional with accents (8 colors, auto light/dark)
- **Simple.css** — Minimalist (auto light/dark)
- **Matcha** — Code-focused with syntax highlighting
- **LaTeX.css** — Academic paper styling
- **Tufte CSS** — Edward Tufte design principles
- **New.css** — Modern minimal (4k+ GitHub stars)

Quick switcher: `⌘⇧P` → `Commentary: Select Theme`

### Smart Storage
- **Workspace mode** (default) — Comments in VS Code state (git-ignored)
- **Sidecar mode** — Comments in `.comments/` folder (git-tracked, shareable)

### Reliable Anchoring
Comments survive document edits with 3-layer fallback:
1. **Exact quote** + context (100 chars before/after)
2. **Character offset** for fast recovery
3. **Nearest heading** + fuzzy search

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install** from [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jaredhughes.commentary)
2. **Open** any Markdown (`.md`) file
3. **Right-click** the file in Explorer → **"Open with Commentary"**
4. **Select text** in the rendered preview → floating comment bubble appears

6. **View all comments** in the Commentary sidebar → `⌘⇧C` / `Ctrl+Shift+C`

**Pro tip:** After adding comments, send them to your AI agent! Automatic methods apply edits directly; manual methods copy to clipboard.

**CLI Tools (Recommended):**
- **Claude Code** — Enter command: `claude` (default, installs automatically)
- **Cursor Agent** — Enter path: `cursor-agent` (requires installation)
- **Codex CLI** — Enter path: `codex` (requires installation)

## Usage

### Creating Comments

**Text Selection Comments:**
1. Select any text in the rendered Markdown preview
2. A floating comment bubble appears
3. Type your comment
4. Press `⌘Enter` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows/Linux) to save
5. Press `Esc` to cancel

**Document-Level Comments:**
You can comment on an entire document without selecting text:
- **In the preview:** Click the note icon button in the top-left corner of the preview
- **In the sidebar:** Click the note icon in the Commentary sidebar toolbar
- **Command Palette:** Press `⌘⇧P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux), then type "Add Document-Level Comment"

### Managing Comments

**View All Comments:**
- Open the Commentary sidebar: `⌘⇧C` / `Ctrl+Shift+C`
- Comments are organized by file
- Click a comment to navigate to its location in the document

**Edit a Comment:**
- In the sidebar, click the edit icon next to the comment
- Or click the comment text to navigate and edit in the preview

**Delete Comments:**
- **Single comment:** Click the trash icon next to the comment in the sidebar
- **All comments:** Click the trash icon in the sidebar toolbar (with confirmation)

**Export/Import:**
- Use the export/import commands to backup or share comments as JSON

### Sending Comments to AI Agent

Commentary supports two types of agent integration: **CLI tools** (Send) and **manual** (Copy).

#### CLI Tools (Send) — Recommended

These methods pipe comments to agentic tools via terminal, **automatically apply edits** to your files, and stay open for follow-up interaction:

- **Claude Code** — Opens terminal with `claude` command, session stays open after processing
- **Cursor Agent** — Opens terminal with `cursor-agent` command, session stays open after processing
- **Codex CLI** — Opens terminal with `codex exec` command for automation mode
- **Gemini CLI** — Opens terminal with `gemini -p` command for non-interactive prompts

**Behavior:**
- Comments are piped to the CLI tool via stdin
- Agent reviews the full document context and applies edits automatically
- Sessions stay open for continued conversation and refinement
- Comments are **deleted from the sidebar** after successful delivery (they've been processed)

#### Manual Methods (Copy)

These methods copy comments to your clipboard for you to paste manually:

- **Claude IDE** — Copies to clipboard, paste into Claude chat (fallback when CLI unavailable)
- **Cursor IDE** — Copies to clipboard, paste into Cursor Composer/Chat (fallback when CLI unavailable)
- **VS Code Chat** — Copies to clipboard, paste into built-in VS Code Chat

**Behavior:**
- Comments are formatted and copied to clipboard
- You paste them into your agent's chat interface
- Comments **remain in the sidebar** for tracking (you manually apply edits)

#### How to Use

**Send a Single Comment:**
- In the sidebar, click the send/copy icon next to any comment
- Icon varies by method: send (CLI providers), copy (clipboard mode)

**Send All Comments:**
- Click the send/copy icon in the sidebar toolbar
- All comments are sent together with full document context

**Which Method is Used?**
- Commentary automatically chooses the best available method based on your configuration
- CLI/API methods are preferred (automatic editing)
- Clipboard methods are used as fallback (manual paste required)

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Theme
```json
{
  "commentary.theme.name": "water-dark"
}
```

### Storage
```json
{
  "commentary.storage.mode": "workspace"  // or "sidecar"
}
```

### AI Agent
```json
{
  "commentary.agent.enabled": true,
  "commentary.agent.provider": "claude",
  "commentary.agent.claudeCliPath": "claude",
  "commentary.agent.cursorCliPath": "cursor-agent",
  "commentary.agent.cursorInteractive": true,
  "commentary.agent.codexCliPath": "codex",
  "commentary.agent.geminiCliPath": "gemini",
  "commentary.agent.contextLines": 6
}
```

**Settings scope:** All settings default to **global/user** but can be overridden per-workspace.

## 🔒 Security Considerations

When you send comments to AI CLI tools, those tools need permission to modify files in your workspace. Each tool handles this differently:

| CLI Tool | Permission Model |
|----------|------------------|
| **Claude Code** | Uses `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` flag to skip interactive prompts |
| **Cursor Agent** | Inherits app-level settings (Auto-run, Auto-apply edits) from Cursor |
| **Codex CLI** | Uses `exec` subcommand for automation mode |
| **Gemini CLI** | Uses `-p` flag for non-interactive prompts |

**Best practices:**
- Review all changes in git before committing (`git diff`)
- Use workspace-level git to track and revert unwanted changes
- Consider running in a separate branch for large refactoring tasks
- Keep your AI CLI tools updated for latest security patches

**Why this is necessary:** CLI tools require non-interactive mode to process comments programmatically. Interactive permission prompts would cause the terminal to hang waiting for input that never comes.
